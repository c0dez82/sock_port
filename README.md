# sock_port

iOS 10.0-12.2 tfp0 for all devices (in theory). Also supports iOS 12.4 (with lower success rate).

Some info:
- Uses socket bug by Ned Williamson
- Uses some things by Ian Beer, machswap, SockPuppet
- The rest of the code is licensed under GPL, unless given permission explicitly to distribute closed-source (the unc0ver team, pwn20wnd and sbingner, have this permission)

Thanks to Pwn20wnd and GeoSn0w & users for helping with testing on multiple devices (and Corellium).
